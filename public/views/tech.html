    <h1 class="helvetica f4">JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      When Brendan Eich invented Javascript back during the days of Netscape, everything changed.
      JavaScript is objectively the greatest programming language ever created.
    </p>

    <p>
      It combines the swiftness of
      untyped languages with functional programming features and a inheritance model that is so simple,
      your grandmother could learn it. You can run it in the browser, or as a web server, or as a desktop application
      that uses hardly any memory at all.
    </p>
    And the best of all is, there exists an online package registry containing
    literally thousands of libraries that do anything you could ever possibly imagine. Every one of these packages
    has been vetted by elite programmers from MIT and Stanford so you basically can't go wrong adding dependencies
    willy-nilly. Have fun! ðŸ¤¡

    <h1 class="helvetica f4">editors and IDEs</h1>
    <p>
      For day-to-day development I stick to VS Code. I find it offers a balanced middle ground between a bloated IDE
      like IntelliJ and a simple text editor like Nano. Extensions that mostly work, lots of updates, and runs
      reasonably quickly.
      If I'm editing something on a remote host I'll fire up trusty ole' Vim for a quick edit. The speed at which I
      can edit text files using common shortcuts is unrivaled.

    <h1 class="helvetica f4">cryptocurrency</h1>
    <p>
      As a <strike>college student</strike> working stiff paying back student loans, I don't have the ability to make
      a lot of investments. One kind of investment that I make an exception for is

          I believe in Bitcoin because I don't believe in the financial system of the Western world.

          Some of the corporations that are the most harmful to privacy and personal freedoms are those which
          profit heavily from the advertisement industry. Advertisements in electronic form are overwhelmingly

        My opinion on the long-term viability of Bitcoin is as follows:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        In a world plagued by inflation largely caused by irresponsible and malicious
        central banking and bloated government beauracracies,
        crytpocurrencies flourish while fiat currencies flounder. Backed by
        decentralized strength via blockchain, the economic robustness granted
        through a finite total possible supply of coin, and transparency through
        open source development, Bitcoin stands to disrupt global finance on a long
        enough timeline. Short the bankers, long BTC.
