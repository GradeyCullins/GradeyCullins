              Welcome to my website. I recently graduated from the
              <a href="http://www.utah.edu/" target="_blank">University of Utah</a>
              with a B.S. in computer science.

              I am currently employed by
              <a href="https://hoodoo.digital/" target="_blank">Hoodoo Digital</a>
              as a software developer, where I mostly write JavaScripts.
            </p>
            <p>Some of my interests include: cryptocurrencies, computer networking, computer games, fitness and nutrition, and world events.
            </p>
            <p>
              What got me hooked me into web programming and computer networking is the story of Ross Ulbricht, the
              inventor of the Silk Road. I highly recommend reading Wired's
              <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/">writeup</a> on his story if you want to
              learn more.

              School taught me early on that in order to work in this industry, one must never stop learning. 
              With this principle in mind, I take an active interest in improving corolary programming skills to
              bolster my technical arsenal.

              <h1 class="helvetica f4">JavaScript</h1>
              <p>
                When Brendan Eich invented Javascript back during the days of Netscape, everything changed. 
                JavaScript is objectively the greatest programming language ever created. 
              </p>  
                
              <p>
                It combines the swiftness of
                untyped languages with functional programming features and a inheritance model that is so simple,
                your Grandman could learn it. You can run it in the browser, or as a web server, or as a desktop application
                that uses hardly any memory at all. 
              </p>
                And the best of all is, there exists an online package registry containing
                literally thousands of libraries that do anything you could ever possibly imagine. Every one of these packages
                has been vetted by elite programmers from MIT and Stanford so you basically can't go wrong adding dependencies
                willy-nilly. Have fun! ðŸ¤¡
              </p>

              <p>
                My first experience with JavaScript was with JQuery and Angular.js (Angular 1). My feelings at the time
                were that JQuery is great up until the project gets very big, and that Angular.js is generally hard to
                understand with weird concepts like $scope. My desire to write JavaScript dwindled considerably.
              </p>
              <p>
                Things turned around after I spent some time learning Angular 2 which completely flipped the script
                and then later Vue which I've been using quite a lot lately. I think front-end JS frameworks have come a long
                way and now focus my technical ire on mind-bending JS build systems like webpack. ðŸ˜¡
              </p>
              <p>
                Back when I was writing Angular 2 code, I appreciated Typescript's offering of hard typing and strict
                enforcement of semicolons. Since taking up Vue, I've adopted an untyped variant called
                <a href="https://standardjs.com/" target="_blank">Javascript Standard Style</a> into all of my 
                personal projects and some of my professional work.

              <h1 class="helvetica f4">editors and IDEs</h1>
              <p>
                For day-to-day development I stick to VS Code. I find it offers a balanced middle ground between a bloated IDE
                like IntelliJ and a simple text editor like Nano. Extensions that mostly work, lots of updates, and runs reasonably quickly.
                If I'm editing something on a remote host I'll fire up trusty ole' Vim for a quick config edit. Vim keybindings are
                what sold me when I encountered the Vim-Emacs crossroads that many developers also encounter.

              <blockquote>
                In a world plagued by inflation largely caused by irresponsible and malicious
                central banking and bloated government beauracracies,
                crytpocurrencies flourish while fiat currencies flounder. Backed by
                decentralized strength via blockchain, the economic robustness granted
                through a finite total possible supply of coin, and transparency through
                open source development, Bitcoin stands to disrupt global finance on a long
                enough timeline. Short the bankers, long BTC.
