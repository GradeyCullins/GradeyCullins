Thanks checking out my blog! Following <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/build-successful-infosec-career/#presence" target="_blank">Daniel Miessler's advice</a>, I've decided to start this blog with the hopes that it helps with my career and personal development. I don't plan to write lengthy, report-like entries. Instead I'll focus on little nuggets of knowledge that I find invaluable (and that hopefully you will find useful too). We'll see how it evolves if I keep with it for long enough.
